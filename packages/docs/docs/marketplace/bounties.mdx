# Bounties

Strata Bounties are an easy way to crowsource funds for an event or task, on chain. They are a wrapper around [Bonding Curves](../learn/bonding_curves).

## How it Works

You can visit the [marketplace](https://marketplace.strataprotocol.com/bounties) to see bounties in action.

When a bounty is created, anyone may deposit funds on the bounty. Currently, bounties only support one mint. If the token is created for SOL, users donate SOL.

Following a deposit, users will recieve a token in equal quantity to their deposit representing their contribution. 
For example, if we are creating a bounty to purchase the Constitution of the United States, contributing 2 SOL to the cause would net you 2 CONSTITUTION tokens.

When a bounty is completed, the `Approver` on the bounty is allowed to disburse the funds. Note that the approver has the ability to do this at any point in time. 

A user can burn their tokens to receive their contributions back until the bounty has been disbursed.

## Anatomy of a Bounty

### The Bonding Curve

Every bounty is a fixed price bonding curve. Put base mint in, get target mint out. Burn target mint, receive base mint. For example, a SOL based bounty would take SOL as the base mint and output a bounty token.

The bonding curve has a `Reserve Authority` that is allowed to withdraw tokens from the reserves of the bonding curve. 

The bonding curve collects all contributions to the bounty. When the bounty is complete, the Approver uses this authority to transfer the tokens and close the bonding curve.

Note that this authority can be a DAO, multisig, or normal wallet.

### The Metadata

In order for a bounty to have a name, symbol, description, and other nice attributes we use [Metaplex Token Metadata](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/token-metadata).

This means that a momento of your contribution will show up in collectibles in most wallets.

## Marketplace SDK

You can initialize the marketplace sdk using an Anchor `Provider` as follows:

```
const marketplaceSdk = await MarketplaceSdk.init(provider)
```

### Creating a Bounty

To create a bounty using SOL, you can run

```js name=create async
var { tokenBonding, targetMint } = await marketplaceSdk.createBounty({
  authority: publicKey, // The approver to disburse the funds
  // The authority to edit the metadata (name, description, etc)
  metadataUpdateAuthority: publicKey, 
  // Metaplex token metadata for the bounty
  metadata: new DataV2({
    // Max name len 32
    name: "Test Bounty",
    symbol: "test",
    // This should be a URI pointing to NFT-like json that includes 
    // name, symbol, description, and attributes from MarketplaceSdk.bountyAttributes
    uri: "",
    sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0,
    creators: null,
    collection: null,
    uses: null,
  }),
  baseMint: NATIVE_MINT,
});
```

Now to deposit money on that bounty, just use a token bonding buy:

```js async deps=create name=buy
await tokenBondingSdk.buy({
  tokenBonding,
  baseAmount: 0.5,
  slippage: 0.05
});
```

To sell,

```js async deps=buy name=sell
await tokenBondingSdk.sell({
  tokenBonding,
  targetAmount: 0.5,
  slippage: 0.05
});
```

To create a bounty with metadata on the frontend, you can use code like this. Assuming that image is a `File` from a file picker:

```js
const targetMintKeypair = Keypair.generate();
const uri = await marketplaceSdk.tokenMetadataSdk.createArweaveMetadata({
  name: "Test ",
  symbol: "test",
  description: "Bounty Description",
  image: image?.name,
  files: [image],
  mint: targetMintKeypair.publicKey,
  attributes: MarketplaceSdk.bountyAttributes({
    mint,
    discussion: values.discussion,
    contact: values.contact
  }),
});
const { targetMint } = await marketplaceSdk.createBounty({
  targetMintKeypair,
  authority,
  metadataUpdateAuthority: marketplaceSdk.provider.wallet.publicKey,
  metadata: new DataV2({
    // Max name len 32
    name: values.name.substring(0, 32),
    symbol: values.shortName.substring(0, 10),
    uri,
    sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0,
    creators: null,
    collection: null,
    uses: null,
  }),
  baseMint: mint,
});
```

You can see more on filling out metadata via the UI looking at [this code](https://github.com/StrataFoundation/strata/blob/master/packages/marketplace-ui/lib/components/form/TokenMetadataInputs.tsx)

This will trigger two transactions. One will pay the arweave fee in SOL, then get your URI. The second will create the bounty.

## Updating a Bounty

To update the metadata of a bounty, you can run:


```js async deps=create
await tokenMetadataSdk.updateMetadata({
  metadata: await Metadata.getPDA(targetMint),
  data: new DataV2({
    // Max name len 32
    name: "New Name",
    symbol: "newSYM,
    uri: "",
    sellerFeeBasisPoints: 0,
    creators: null,
    collection: null,
    uses: null,
  }),
})
```

To update the approver, you can run:

```js async 
await tokenBondingSdk.updateTokenBonding({
  tokenBonding,
  generalAuthority: publicKey,
  reserveAuthority: publicKey,
});
```

### Withdrawing Funds

The `authority` param (defaulted to the wallet creating the bounty) is allowed to withdraw the funds from
the bounty. This is done via the `transferReserves` command.

```js async deps=lbc
await tokenBondingSdk.transferReserves({
  tokenBonding,
  amount: 0.001,
  destination: publicKey
})
```

You can also close and permanently shutdown the curve via `close`, which can only be done when the reserves are empty. This will
recover the rent fees stored in the curve.
```js
import { getAssociatedAccountBalance } from "@strata-foundation/spl-utils";
```

```js async deps=lbc
var tokenBondingAcct = await tokenBondingSdk.getTokenBonding(tokenBonding);
var transferInstrs =
  await tokenBondingSdk.transferReservesInstructions({
    amount: (await provider.connection.getTokenAccountBalance(tokenBondingAcct.baseStorage)).value.uiAmount,
    destination: publicKey,
    tokenBonding,
  });
var { instructions, signers } =
  await tokenBondingSdk.closeInstructions({
    tokenBonding
  });
await tokenBondingSdk.sendInstructions(
  [...transferInstrs.instructions, ...instructions],
  [...transferInstrs.signers, ...signers]
);
```

### Searching Bounties

If you're using react, you can use the `useBounties` hook from `@strata-foundation/marketplace-ui`

Otherwise, you can search by mint:

```js async
var bounties = await marketplaceSdk.getBounties({
  baseMint: NATIVE_MINT
})
```

## React

See the basic [React](../react) setup to get your Solana setup with wallets working. Then,

```jsx
import { MarketplaceSdkProvider } from "@strata-foundation/marketplace-ui";

<MarketplaceSdkProvider>
  { ... your components ... }
</MarketplaceSdkProvider>
```

This will allow you to use the `useMarketplaceSdk` hook,

```jsx
const { marketplaceSdk } = useMarketplaceSdk();
```

### Bounty List

```
import { BountyCard, useBounties } from "@strata-foundation/marketplace-ui";
```

```jsx live
function BountyList() {
  const { result: bounties, error, loading } = useBounties({
    baseMint: NATIVE_MINT,
    search: "",
    sortType: "GO_LIVE",
    sortDirection: "DESC",
    limit: 5
  });

  if (loading || !bounties) {
    return <div>Loading</div>
  }

  return bounties && bounties.map((bounty) => (
            <BountyCard
              onClick={() => console.log("Clicked: ", bounty.targetMint.toBase58())}
              key={bounty.tokenBondingKey.toBase58()}
              mintKey={bounty.targetMint}
            />
          ))  
}
```

### Bounty Details
```
import { BountyDetail } from "@strata-foundation/marketplace-ui";
```
```jsx async
  const mintKey = new PublicKey("5RgTTRS6E6RVQZKwuYbZa29FjMk3Dhq8bT6dKpkF4DL3")

```
```jsx live

function Bounty() {
  const { mintKey } = useVariables();
  return <BountyDetail mintKey={mintKey} />
}
```
