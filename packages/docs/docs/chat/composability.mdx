# Composability

Strata Chat is built for composability. As we saw in [Getting Started](./getting_started),
you can easily create token gated chatrooms and embed them anywhere.

Strata Chat goes one step further. Because a chatroom is just transaction history
on a given account, you can customize the logic and requirements to send a message.

Want to require 2 DeGods and 100 $DUST to post a message? Write your own custom program!

Want to tax advertizers for sending messages? This is also possible.

## Creating a Custom Send Message

To create a custom send message function, first you must implement an anchor program that takes
a Chat Message as args:

https://github.com/StrataFoundation/strata/tree/master/programs/chat/src/instructions/send_message/send_token_message_v0.rs

If your chat requires any custom permissions, it is recommended you implement those as a PDA on chat, similar to `ChatPermissions` in the Strata chat contract:

https://github.com/StrataFoundation/strata/tree/master/programs/chat/src/instructions/initialize_chat_permissions_v0.rs

Once you have created a custom program, you can create a chat that uses that program via:

```jsx async name=create_chat
var { chat } =
  await chatSdk.initializeChat({
      name,
      postMessageProgramId = new PublicKey("... your program id ..."),
    });
```

If you would like to use our chat components, you will need to override the `SendMessageContext`.

This will allow you to implement custom sendMessage logic.
