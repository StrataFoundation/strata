# Wum.bo Beta OPEN Distribution

If you participated in the beta of Wum.bo, you should have been airdropped netbWUM. A token which represented your overall total earnings from the beta. If you ended up holding it and not swapping for SOL in the first round of the [beta distribution](/blog/wumbo-beta-dist) then congrats!

The time has come for you to be able to swap the netbWUM to OPEN, the first collective launching on Strata and the default collective for any unbonded social token. You can read more about the Open Collecive [here.](/blog/open-collective)

At the time of this post, and the decommisioning of the netbWUM to SOL exchange, there was 388.57 SOL left unclaimed in the beta rewards pool. We have gone ahead and added an additional 10% (38.857)SOL to the pool as a thanks for sticking with us and converted it all to OPEN.
