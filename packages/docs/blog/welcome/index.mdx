Strata is bridging the divide between individuals and community by providing powerful shared incentive structures. Strata infrastructure will fuel the next wave of innovation in the Creator Economy.

Built on [Solana](https://solana.com/), Strata is the fastest and least expensive way to create, manage, and build economies of Social Tokens and Collectives.

## What's a Social Token?

Let’s start first with the definition of a Token:

  > A token is an object that represents something else, such as another object (either physical or virtual).

Tokens are easy to move around, track ownership, and impossible to fake. We can represent anything with a token, which allows people to freely move ownership in a convenient way. 

A Social Token is a Token that belongs to an individual. It allows you to create, monetize, and drive value to your own token.

## Collectives

What if the value of your token was not just related to your own efforts, but also the efforts of your community? A group of people is able to pool resources and innovate on a larger scale.

At the heart of Social Tokens are [Bonding Curves](/docs/concepts/bonding_curves) that allow free and instant trading of a token without the need for an exchange or liquidity provider. A Bonding Curve ties one token to the value of another token.

:::info Collective
A Collective is a group of Social Tokens bound to the same base token. This means that every Social Token owner is incentive aligned to increase not just the value of their token, but the value/utility of the Collective
:::

## Free and Open

The key to innovation is rapid iteration and exploration. We believe that taking a cut will stifle innovation. As such, Strata is completely free to use and Open Source. The smart contracts take no share of the tokens exchanged. Strata will eventually form a DAO to govern the smart contracts.

## Emergent Phenomena

The core goal of Strata is to provide infrastrucutre for the next wave of innovation in the Creator Economy. As such, the protocol remains as non prescriptive as possible. 

A large amount of customization is available to enable new and innovative business models. Every bonding curve can have royalties on buy and sell, both in terms of the base token and the bonded token. Base tokens can be injected back into the bonding curve to increase value for all token holders. Royalties can be taken for a collective, or on an individual token. 

Strata allows complete customization and control of both creator coins and collectives, but also hides complexity using sane defaults.

Some possible business models are:

  * Create a storefront for Social Tokens and take a small fee for every sale.
  * Charge for a service that restricts access to content using Social Tokens
  * Create a Collective around a shared goal and collect royalties on shares of the collective token
  * Take royalties on a Social Token in exchange for building a website or game around the token
  * Create a platform to explore and engage with backers
