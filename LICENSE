You will notice there are two licenses in this repository, one under `packages` and one under `programs`.

The program and rust code for Strata is licensed under AGPL v3. 

The Typescript SDK and all typescript libraries are licensed under Apache 2.0 license. 

The intention is that the sdks allow wider use than the programs. In particular, you may call out to the Strata programs publicly deployed on-chain using closed source code.

You may not, however, fork and close source the program code. Any deployments of Strata program code and derivative code to the blockchain should be open source.
